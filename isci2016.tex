% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{pic/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
How the brain works still remains a mystery and attracts researchers from various areas attempting to understand it.
Nowadays, the exciting reports of the beating-human visual recognition and decision making have brought deep learning into the spotlight.
It provides a clue which may unveil the mechanism of neural processing in the brain.
Therefore, it becomes a hot topic to train and operate deep learning on spiking neural networks(SNN) underline the more biologically realistic way.
This paper proposed a supervised learning rule to train the Autoencoders of spiking neurons using Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP).
A network of two-layer Autoencoders was trained on the MNIST database with Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neurons.
This results demonstrate the equivalent recognition capability comparing to the non-spiking implementations and validate the training ability of the learning rule of the biologically plausible spiking neurons.

	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most promising research field in computer vision, even exceeding human-level performance on image classification tasks~\cite{he2015delving}.
	To investigate whether brains might work similarly on vision tasks, these powerful DNN models have been converted to spiking neural networks (SNNs).
	In addition, the spiking DNN offers the prospect of neuromorphic systems that combine remarkable performance with energy-efficient training and operation.
	
	Theoretical studies have shown that biologically-plausible learning, e.g. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), could approximate a stochastic version of powerful machine learning algorithms	~\cite{nessler2013bayesian,neftci2013event,neftci2013event,o2016deep}.
	such as Expectation Maximization~\cite{nessler2013bayesian}, 
	Contrastive Divergence~\cite{neftci2013event}, Markov Chain Monte Carlo~\cite{buesing2011neural} and Gradient Descent~\cite{o2016deep}.
	Stochasticity, in contrast with the continuously differentiable functions used by ANNs, is intrinsic to the event-based spiking process, making network training difficult.
	
	state-of-the-art of learning on SNN\cite{ponulak2010supervised,neftci2013event,burbank2015mirrored}

\subsection{Training Autoencoders}
	%TODO rewording
	Figure~\ref{fig:AE} shows a simplest architecture of an autoencoder, which is the same as a multilayer perceptron (MLP).
	The only difference lies to the number of the output units, where an autoencoder has as many output neurons as the input.
	In this example, the input layer feeds forward the data vector $\mathbf{v}$ to the hidden layer as weighted sum of the data, $\mathbf{net\_h}$.
	Then the hidden units are activated by the input $\mathbf{net\_h}$ according to the activation function: $\mathbf{h}=\sigma(\mathbf{net\_h})$.
	Finally, using the same approach the output of the network is generated, $\mathbf{v'}=\sigma(\mathbf{net\_v'})$, as the reconstruction of the input data.
	Thus, autoencoders are trained without given target values, work as unsupervised learning models.	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{AE}
			\caption{A typical Autoencoder structure.}
			\label{fig:AE}
	\end{figure}
	
	%TODO why tied weights are good
	Notice that the connections used in the example are tied weights.
	\begin{equation}
	h_j=\sigma(\sum_i v_i w^T_{ij})
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	v'_j=\sigma(\sum_i h_i w_{ij})
	\end{equation}
	
	Training an autoencoder is not different from backpropagation (BP) on an Multi-Layer Perceptrons(MLP).
	The objective of training is to minimise the prediction error of an MLP, which measured as a loss function.
	Accordingly, the loss function of an autoencoder can be described as:
	\begin{equation}
	L=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\|\mathbf{v}_{k}-\mathbf{v'}_{k}\|=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{K}(\mathbf{v}_{k}-\mathbf{v'}_{k})^{2}
	\end{equation}
	where k indicates the index of the training data $\mathbf{v}$, and each data vector $\mathbf{v}=\{v_0, v_1,...,v_N\}$ and its reconstruction $\mathbf{v'}=\{v'_0, v'_1,...,v'_N\}$ have N dimensions. 

	%TODO rewording
	Backpropagation, an abbreviation for "backward propagation of errors", is a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent.
	The method calculates the gradient of a loss function with respect to all the weights in the network.
	The gradient is fed to the optimisation method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the loss function:
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta W \propto -\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}.
	\end{equation}

	Applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the true gradient of the weight matrix, $\Delta W$, is approximated by a gradient at a single example with iterations.
	The reconstruction error $E_k$ of an input vector $\mathbf{v}_k$ is as given:
	\begin{equation}
%	\begin{align*}
	E_k = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{v}_k - \mathbf{v'}_k)^2,
%	\end{align*}
	\end{equation}
	and the gradient of the weight matrix is:
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta W \propto -\frac{\partial E_k}{\partial W}=-\eta \frac{\partial E_k}{\partial W},
	\end{equation}
	where $\eta$ is the learning rate.
	
	Since we use tied weights in the network, the weight tuning only needs to apply in the output layer.
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\Delta w_{ij} = -\eta \frac{\partial E_k}{\partial w_{ij}} &= -\eta \frac{\partial E_k}{\partial v'_j} \frac{\partial v'_j}{\partial net\_v'_j} \frac{\partial net\_v'_j}{\partial w_{ij}}, \textrm{ where} \\
	\frac{\partial E_k}{\partial v'_j} &= \frac{\partial \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{v}_k - \mathbf{v'}_k)^2}{\partial v'_j}= -(v'_j - v_j), \\
%	\frac{\partial v'_j}{\partial net\_v'_j} &= \begin{cases} 1, v'_j>0\\0, v'_j<=0\\ \end{cases}, \textrm{using ReLU,}\\
	\frac{\partial v'_j}{\partial net\_v'_j} &= 1, \textrm{using Identify function,}\\
	\frac{\partial net\_v'_j}{\partial w_{ij}} &= \frac{\partial h_i w_{ij}}{\partial w_{ij}} = h_i.
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	Thus, the weight gradient is calculated as:
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta w_{ij} = \eta h_i(v'_j - v_j)
	\end{equation}
	
	Examples of using an autoencoder with 10 input neurons and 10 hidden neurons: reconstruction the input data $\mathbf{v}$ where I) $v_i = 1$, II) $v_i = i/10$.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
